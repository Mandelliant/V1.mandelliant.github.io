## Blockchain

A blockchain is a type of data structure and as such the term functions in a sentence similar to something like *relational database*.

*e.g. I'm not sure how I want to store my website's transaction data, in a relational database or on a blockchain.*

**Note:** Data is stored *on* a blockchain, as opposed to *in* a database.


## Cryptocurrencies

### Bitcoin
<br>
Bitcoin is capitalized when referring to the network.

*e.g. Did you hear Bitcoin reached nearly 500,000 transactions yesterday?*
